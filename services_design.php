            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>Testing usability is vital to creating a successful website.Most designers spend too much time with their designs to be objective about them. The best thing any designer can do is to collect feedback from real users. Testing uncovers pain points and flaws in a design that are not otherwise obvious.The incredible growth of mobile and the proliferation of mobile devices has made the UX designer’s job more challenging and interesting. </p>
